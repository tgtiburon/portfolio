## Description

I was given the task of creating a Portfolio for myself. I made sure to structure the html and css for both readability and for accessibity. I used semantic elements and added other elements to make the website more accessible for users who would be using a reader to access the site. In addition to this I organized the html and css to be in a logical order as well as be efficient by consolodating classes that were reusing code.
