## Tony Gendreau's Portfolio



I was given the task of taking an index.html and a style.css which created a functional website for a company called Horiseon.  The website was pleasing to look at but was lacking in how the html and css was structured for both readability and for accessibity.  I replaced many of the non-semantic elements with semantic ones and added other elements to make the website more accessible for users who would be using a reader to access the site.  In addition to this I reorganized the html and css to be in a more logical order as well as be more efficient by consolodating classes that were reusing code.

#Skills I demonstrate in this project

  1. Proper implementation of the <nav> element.
  2. Proper implementation of the <hero> element.
  3. Implementation of <main> and <aside> to create an efficient webpage.
  4. Implementation of accessiblity features for users who need it.
  5. Proper implementation of <footer> and <header> elements.
  6. Use of /*#region/ to make code easier to read.
  7. Use of comments to make code be easily maintained in the future.
  
  
 #Why did I do this project?
  
  As a new developer I worked on this project as a way to solidify my understanding in how html and css can be used to not only create a website, but to created a website that is pleasant to look at, but also be useful to those who need accomidation.
