## Tony Gendreau's Portfolio



I was given the task of creating a Portfolio for myself. I made sure to structure the html and css for both readability and for accessibity.  I used semantic elements and added other elements to make the website more accessible for users who would be using a reader to access the site.  In addition to this I organized the html and css to be in a logical order as well as be efficient by consolodating classes that were reusing code.

## Skills I demonstrate in this project

  1. Proper implementation of the \<nav> element to create a navigation menu.
  2. Proper implementation of the \<hero> element.
  3. Implementation of \<main> to create an efficient webpage.
  4. Implementation of accessiblity features for users who need it.
  5. Proper implementation of \<footer> and \<header> elements.
  6. Use of /*#region/ to make code easier to read.
  7. Use of comments to make code be easily maintained in the future.
  8. I used hover to make the images feel more interactive.
  9. I created links to outside sites such as Linkedin that open in a new tab.
  10. I turned my resume into an interactive web page.
  
  
 ## Why did I do this project?
  
   I worked on this project as a way to solidify my understanding in how html and css can be used to not only create a website, but to create a website that is pleasant to look at, but also be useful to those who need accomidations.  In addition it will serve as my portfolio of my work while looking for a position as a full stack web developer.
